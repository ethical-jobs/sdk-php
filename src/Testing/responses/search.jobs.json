Through science, community, and enduring commitment, we inspire and empower people to conserve nature in Tasmania; we do this for the benefit of current and future human generations and for nature itself.</p>\n<p>We conserve important habitats and ecosystems by raising funds to buy and manage private land and by working with landholders to protect nature on their land</p>\n<p>Tasmania has a wonderful natural heritage with over 50% of the state already protected by magnificent reserves. We are superbly placed to develop one of the world's leading protected area systems - a reserve system that provides sufficient habitat for the long-term survival of our biodiversity.</p>\n<p>The TLC strategy is to build a system of secure core areas managed for conservation. Our aim is to conserve and manage an additional 30,000 hectares of land for nature conservation by 2025 through reserves and through management for conservation.</p>\n<p>Some land becomes TLC reserves, protected by conservation covenants. Other land goes into our 'revolving fund': it is permanently legally protected with a conservation covenant and resold to conservation-minded buyers. The TLC also works with landowners to protect the ecological values of their properties through conservation programs including the Midlands Conservation Fund, Land for Wildlife and WildTracker. In 21 years of operation, the organisation has protected more than 96,000 hectares through our activity.</p>\n<h3>The Position</h3>\n<p>The Communications Coordinator operates within the Philanthropy &amp; Engagement Team to ensure that TLC has a visible, engaging profile both in Tasmania and nationally.</p>\n<p>Specific duties include the management of content across the organisation&rsquo;s communication tools, management of the website, cultivation of media relations, crafting fundraising campaign messages, and developing TLC&rsquo;s key messages and storytelling.</p>\n<p>We are looking for a tertiary qualified candidate with demonstrated experience writing, editing and proofing copy for a variety of publication platforms. Experience in a communications, public relations or an equivalent position, is a must.
